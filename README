caldav server classes. This project contains the implementation of a caldav
server for the bedework calendar system.

In addition it contains freebusy only proxy servers for domino, exchange and
google.

The bedework quickstart will build and deploy the bedework caldav server by
default.

The remaining servers can be enabled by adding the properties
org.bedework.build.caldav.bexchange=yes
org.bedework.build.caldav.domino=yes
org.bedework.build.caldav.google=yes
to your <home>/bedework.build.properties

Building the proxy servers might require at least java5
